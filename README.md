# Say Hello to RocketShip

My framework of Caspian2 (which is now claimed for branding conpyrights) is now named RocketShip.

go to [RocketShip's repository](https://github.com/4c4-mgiroux/RocketShip) to get the framework. But if you are looking for the Caspian2 branch, which in time will be very different from RocketShip, you can get it at [QuatreCentQuatre's repo](https://github.com/QuatreCentQuatre/Caspian2)
